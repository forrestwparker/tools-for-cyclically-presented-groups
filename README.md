# tools-for-cyclically-presented-groups

This is a set of GAP code I wrote to assist in research for my doctoral thesis. A preprint of the results is [available on arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.05496). I hope these files will be of some use to others who pursue a similar path. The code is provided under [GPLv2](./LICENSE).

### Still to do:
Documentation of the functionality.
Clean up the comments in the code.
